# Ember-paper

This project aims to bring Google's new [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) to Ember. The goal is to encapsulate everything possible in Ember components. This project is packaged as an [Ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) addon. This a allows a much nicer "plug and play" experience, as you can see for yourself in the "Installation" section.

## Installation

Install the ember-cli addon in your ember-cli project:

```
$ npm install --save-dev ember-paper
```

All the components and styles are ready to use in your application templates.
Navigate through the docs to understand how to use each component.

## Contribution

This is a very ambitious project. Google's design specs are extensive, and not trivial to implement. I've been porting [Polymer Paper Elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html) and [Google Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/tree/material-sprint) (material-spring branch) to Ember. These seem to be the most useful resources at the moment. If you feel like porting or fixing an element or two, please drop a pull request or issue at GitHub!


I believe that with the help of everyone we can bring these amazing design spec to Ember in a modular and robust way. The Ember way. **Help us on Github!**
